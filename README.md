# Hys Cute
An operating system made by me. I love song thats why I named it this way.\n
*Currently on very early stages of the OS, things might change drastically.*
## Current status
Current release: 0.1 \n
Only has booting right now. Will grow soon.
It targets only x86_64. Maybe ARM or RISC-V in the future.

## Build
You will need a Cross compiler, just like my bootloader projects, ngbl. However, unlike ngbl, you will need a x86_64 compiler instead of i386.
After acquiring a cross compiler, type ```make```.
If you have grub and xorriso, you can type ```make iso``` to create an ISO file.

## Future/targets
The Kernel will consist of languages such as Rust and C. Cpp won't be added. I'm sorry Nadeem.
This is just a hobby project. It might be abandonned.

## Secret
You might be wondering what song is. Go search up fromis_9.
